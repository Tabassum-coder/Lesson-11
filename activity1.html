<p><span>Apples</span> are round, edible fruits that grow on apple trees. They are one of the most popular fruits in the world and
    are
    high in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants. Apples come in a variety of colors and flavors, including sweet red
    varieties like Red Delicious, Fuji, or Gala, and tangy green varieties like Granny Smith.

    Here are some things to know about apples:

    Health benefits
    Apples can be a healthy addition to a balanced diet and may help reduce the risk of several conditions, such as
    cancer,
    obesity, heart disease, and diabetes.

    Uses
    Apples can be eaten raw, used in recipes like pies, cookies, muffins, jam, salads, oatmeal, or smoothies, or wedged
    and
    smeared with nut butter.

    Origin
    The apple tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found.
    Cultivation
    Apple trees require careful attention to pruning, especially during the first five years. Mature trees also need a
    rigorous spraying regime to protect against insect pests and diseases.
